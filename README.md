## 🚀 Quick Start — Clone & Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before you begin:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 or above (check with `node -v`)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v8 or above
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) account (free tier works)
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account (for media uploads)
- A [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/) account (for payment integration)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mulikshivam02/StudyNotion.git
cd StudyNotion-EdTech
```

---

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

From the **root** of the project:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

---

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

#### Backend `.env` — create `server/.env`:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Cloudinary
CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
FOLDER_NAME=StudyNotion

# Razorpay
RAZORPAY_KEY=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret

# Nodemailer / Mail
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password

# Server
PORT=4000
```

#### Frontend `.env` — create `.env` in the root:

```env
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
```

---

### 5. Run the Application

**Option A — Run both together (recommended):**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the React frontend (`localhost:3000`) and the Express backend (`localhost:4000`) concurrently.

**Option B — Run separately:**

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
npm start
```

---

### 6. Open in Browser

```
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend API: http://localhost:4000/api/v1
```

## 📖 Project Overview

**StudyNotion** is a feature-rich, fully responsive EdTech web platform that brings together students, instructors, and administrators on a single unified system. The platform enables instructors to create and manage courses with rich multimedia content, while students can browse, purchase, and consume that content at their own pace — all backed by a secure payment gateway, real-time progress tracking, OTP-based email verification, and cloud-hosted media.

This project demonstrates a complete production-grade MERN stack architecture — from JWT-based authentication and role-based access control, to Cloudinary media pipelines, Razorpay payment webhooks, and a fully componentised React frontend powered by Redux Toolkit.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

<div align="center">
  <img src="./public/architecture.png" alt="System Architecture Diagram" width="80%"/>
  <p><em>Three-tier architecture: React frontend communicates with the Express/Node.js backend via RESTful APIs, and the backend persists data to MongoDB Atlas.</em></p>
</div>

The application follows a clean three-tier separation:

- **Frontend** (React + Redux) — Handles UI rendering, client-side routing, and API calls via Axios. Redux Toolkit manages global state for authentication, cart, course progress, and user profiles.
- **Backend** (Node.js + Express.js) — Exposes RESTful API endpoints. Handles business logic, JWT middleware for protected routes, role-based guards (`isStudent`, `isInstructor`, `isAdmin`), and integrates with all third-party services.
- **Database** (MongoDB + Mongoose) — Stores all persistent data: users, courses, sections, subsections, ratings, progress, and invoices.

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

<div align="center">
  <img src="./public/schema.jpg" alt="MongoDB Schema / ERD Diagram" width="90%"/>
  <p><em>Entity-relationship diagram showing all MongoDB collections and their references.</em></p>
</div>

The database is composed of the following collections:

| Collection | Description |
|---|---|
| **Users** | Stores all user accounts (students, instructors, admins) with account type and approval status |
| **Profile** | Extended profile data (gender, DOB, bio, contact number) linked to a User |
| **Courses** | Course metadata — name, description, price, thumbnail, instructor reference, enrolled students |
| **Section** | Top-level sections within a course (e.g., "Module 1: Intro") |
| **SubSection** | Individual lessons/videos within a section, including video URL and duration |
| **CourseProgress** | Tracks which subsections a student has completed per course |
| **RatingAndReviews** | Student ratings and text reviews linked to a course |
| **Category** | Course tags/categories for filtering and catalog browsing |
| **Invoices** | Purchase records tied to user and course |
| **OTP** | Temporary OTP records with TTL expiration for email verification |

## 🔮 Future Improvements

The following enhancements are planned for future versions of StudyNotion, prioritised by impact:

### 🔴 High Priority

**Personalised Learning Paths**
Creating individualised learning journeys for each student based on their interests, skill level, and learning style. The system would analyse course completion patterns and recommend a tailored sequence of courses and modules to maximise student success and retention.

**Mobile Application**
Developing a native mobile app (React Native) for iOS and Android to bring the full platform experience to smartphones. Mobile access would allow students to download lessons for offline viewing, receive push notifications, and learn on the go — significantly expanding the platform's reach.

### 🟡 Medium Priority

**Gamification Features**
Introducing badges, XP points, leaderboards, and course completion streaks to increase learner engagement and motivation. Gamification elements have been shown to meaningfully improve course completion rates in online learning environments.

**Social Learning Features**
Adding collaborative tools such as course-specific discussion forums, peer-to-peer assignment reviews, group projects, and live study sessions. Social interaction within the learning context improves engagement, accountability, and real-world skill development.

**Machine Learning–Powered Recommendations**
Implementing an ML recommendation engine that analyses a student's browsing history, completed courses, ratings, and peer behaviour to surface highly relevant course suggestions. This would improve discoverability and increase enrolment conversion rates.

### 🟢 Additional Enhancements

- **Live Classes** — Integrating WebRTC or Zoom SDK to support live instructor-led sessions and Q&A
- **Quizzes & Assignments** — Adding in-course assessments with automated grading and instructor feedback
- **Certificate Generation** — Issuing downloadable, verifiable PDF completion certificates upon course finish
- **Multilingual Support** — Localisation and i18n support to reach a global student audience
- **Dark / Light Mode** — User-toggleable theme preference
- **Admin Analytics Dashboard** — Platform-wide analytics for total revenue, active users, top courses, and growth trends

## ✅ Conclusion

StudyNotion is a comprehensive, production-ready EdTech platform that demonstrates the full breadth of the MERN stack — from database modelling and REST API design, to JWT authentication, third-party service integration, and a polished React frontend. The three-role system (student, instructor, admin) creates a complete ecosystem where educators can monetise their knowledge and learners can invest in their skills, all on one seamless platform.

The architecture is intentionally scalable: the decoupled frontend/backend design, cloud-hosted media pipeline (Cloudinary), and payment abstraction (Razorpay) make it straightforward to extend with new features, integrate additional services, or migrate individual layers without affecting the rest of the system. The roadmap items — personalised learning paths, ML recommendations, gamification, and a mobile app — represent a natural evolution path toward a best-in-class learning platform.
